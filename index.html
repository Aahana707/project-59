    <p>In my pass time I do many things like reading,cycling,basketball,swiming and painting. Altough I had to stop most of those because the lock down started. Mostly I just read books. A few books i read through the lockdown were "Keepers Of The Lost Cites by Shannon Messenger" and "Percy Jackson and the Olympians by Rick Riordan".I read most of these books on my kindle.</p>

            <p>During the past week or so I have been reading a book called keepers of the lost cities, written by Shannon Messenger. Up till now, it has eight books: Keeper of the Lost Cities, Exile, Everblaze, Neverseen, Lodestar, Nightfall, Flashback, and Legacy. The story is about Sophie Elizabeth Foster and her friends Keefe Sencen, Fitzroy Avery Vacker, Biana Vacker, Dexter Alvin Dizznee, Tam Song, Linh Song, Wylie Endal, Marella Redek. Sophie who learns that her whole life was based on a lie, she learns that she is not a normal human but an Elf. Then she has to leave her human parents Her human father was William David Foster (Connor Freeman), her human mother is Emma Iris Foster (Kate Freeman), and her sister is Amy Rose Foster(Natalie Freeman). When Sophie left for the Lost cities, Washers relocated her human family and wiped all their memories of Sophie so they didn't have to think their daughter died. This is why they have new names. she was adopted by Edaline and Grady Ruewen. She soon realizes that she has some dangerous enemies who are willing to do anything to get what they want. She and her friends constantly get hurt because of them. She barely knows what she is up against, but she is determined to keep everyone safe. 

I love how I get involved in the book, it is a great thriller to read. I love this book and rate it 5/5 stars.

            <p>She put up her grumpiest face, her face nearly red from anger. She was still processing how they tricked her into going on a track. She muttered a thousand curses under her breath. . After somehow cooling her down they went ahead. Although all she saw was the dirty muddy hard ground. Everyone around her nearly burst out of laughter, when a tiny miny spect of dirt touch her skin no one could see it even with binocular. They went no without a word. unfortunately, she sat down on a rock, no one saw her do so, and they continued walking. she was left behind near a cold dark waterfall the only sound was the crashing of the water. Then suddenly there was a dozen of gost flying overhead she had nearly fainted when the unmasked themself, it was just her friends playing tricks on her again. Before she could bash them up they ran away.Oh they were so doomed</p></section>
